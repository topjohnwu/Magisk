  This feature is supposed to only allow one single option, but apparently adb shell su -c "command" doesn't work this way, and plenty of root apps don't follow the rule. The su binary will now consider everything after -c as a part of the command.
- [MagiskSU] Removed legacy context hack for TiBack, what it currently does is slowing down the invocation
